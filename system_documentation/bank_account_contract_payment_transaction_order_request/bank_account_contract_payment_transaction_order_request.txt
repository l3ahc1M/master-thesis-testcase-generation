Example:
Banks can integrate different online channels where payment transaction orders can be initiated e.g. online banking, ATMs, branch solutions, call center solutions.
a. Payment Transaction Order is initiated via a UI where a customer or an employee is interacting with a UI based channel. Example online banking, branch application, call center or ATM
b. This Payment Transaction Order is executed online. This means real-time posting of ordering party and real time posting of recipient party if internal within the bank and technically possible.
c. Channel application expects an online confirmation of the execution of the payment transaction order.Remark:
The current modelling of BankAccountContractPaymentTransactionOrderRequest is limited to payment transaction orders with one recipient item.
