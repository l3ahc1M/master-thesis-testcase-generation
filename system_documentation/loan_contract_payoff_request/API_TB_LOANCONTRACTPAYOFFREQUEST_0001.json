Note:The fields marked as nullable can be passed with blank value. But the field name has to be passed always. Remark:Bank Account Billing is a process that determines amounts that a holder of a bank account is expected to pay for a specified period. As of CB4HANA 100 the gross amount calculation result is based exclusively on the completeness of the list of unpaid bank account billing items specified by this node. No validation will be done on completeness of the list. Example:If there are 3 UnpaidBankAccountBillingEntries with following IDs: UnpaidBankAccountBillingEntry  ID1 = 100 EUR,  UnpaidBankAccountBillingEntry  ID2 = 120 EUR, UnpaidBankAccountBillingEntry  ID3 = 150 EUR  And if 'UnpaidBankAccountBillingEntry ID1' is to be included in the calculation of a full payoff, then it is necessary to pass the complete list of unpaid bank account billing items in order to determine the correct gross payoff amount. i.e., the IDs need to be passed as below: ID1 -> Selected Indicator as TRUE ID2 -> Selected Indicator as FALSE ID2 -> Selected Indicator as FALSE",

Remark:As of CB4HANA 100 the gross amount calculation result is based exclusively on the completeness of the list of unpaid bank account billing items specified by this node. No validation will be done on completeness of the list. Example:If there are 3 UnpaidBankAccountBillingEntries with following IDs: UnpaidBankAccountBillingEntry  ID1 = 100 EUR, UnpaidBankAccountBillingEntry  ID2 = 120 EUR, UnpaidBankAccountBillingEntry  ID3 = 150 EUR  And if 'UnpaidBankAccountBillingEntry ID1' is to be included in the calculation of a partial payoff, then it is necessary to pass the complete list of unpaid bank account billing items in order to determine the correct gross payoff amount. i.e., the IDs need to be passed as below: ID1 -> Selected Indicator as TRUE ID2 -> Selected Indicator as FALSE ID2 -> Selected Indicator as FALSE",
